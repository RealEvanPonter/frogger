Gameplay:

Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the player.
Try to move the player across the stone path and into the water.
Reaching the water will award you 5 points.
If the player is hit by a bug, the player is reset to the initial location and 1 point is subtracted from the score.
Good luck!
